		<h2>DESIGN ETHOS</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section-container">
		<p>Design is a process, and as a designer I strive to understand and be involved with each step of that process so that nothing is lost in translation during that journey from ideation to implementation. By bringing an in-depth understanding of the research process and a strong background in computer science to the design table, I can ensure any products or services I envision are both viable and rooted in reliable, tangible data.</p>

		<p>I also believe that the greatest ideas in the world are completely meaningless unless you're able to communicate and advocate them to other people. Design is as much about transmitting ideas as it is coming up with them in the first place, and with that in mind I've honed my presentation and interpersonal skills to a fine edge with years of practice at both a university and professional level.</p>

    		<p>My name is Alexander Strandberg, and I'm a student of user experience design. I'm looking for new and exciting ways to combine my passion for technology with my penchant for creative design.</p>

    		<p>I graudated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Pysch and a strong focus on computer science classes. My background in research, design, and coding allows me to communicate with people at every level of the design process in the language they're familiar with.</p>

			<p>Programs I'm experienced in include C, HTML, CSS, Python, Axure, Github, Surveymonkey, Draw.IO, and the entire Microsoft Office Suite. I'm also pursuing a deeper understanding of Javascript and Ruby so that I can design more readily with them in mind. Beyond that, I'm a quick learner and incredibly tech savvy, so I can pick up new skills and programs without trouble.</p>
